        cardDescription="In May of 2022, we shared Angular’s vision for the future, where we committed to investing in server side rendering and hydration. Angular has had support for server side rendering through Angular Universal, which originally came into being thanks to third party contributors. Eventually Angular Universal became the official SSR library for Angular."
