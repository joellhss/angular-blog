      "Fast forward to 2023, and SSR is now an essential part of modern web applications and has been for a few years. We’ve conducted surveys and the community has let us know that server side rendering is the top area Angular users want improvements. As a result of your feedback and the changed landscape around SSR, we have made server side rendering a top priority in 2023.",

      "Multiple issues have been opened on the Angular GitHub repository related to hydration (e.g. #13446 & #23427) since 2016. One of the most prominent issues is the flicker that occurs between the time the page is rendered and when the page is ready for interaction by users. That flicker is due to Angular having destroyed and repainted the DOM structures after re-bootstrapping on the client. There have been different approaches used to reduce the flicker so it’s less noticeable. However, it is still visible in tooling like Lighthouse and WebPageTest and can also affect statistics like cumulative layout shift (CLS)."
